README is still a TODO

## Setup
Setup for this project is pretty standard. Just install the npm dependencies.

To start, ensure that node and npm are installed using `node --version && npm --version`.

### Packages
Run `npm install` to install all packages.

## Testing
To test, use `npm test`. The server must be manually stopped after testing (ctrl + c).

## Running the Server Locally
To run the server locally, run `npm start`.

Other scripts can be found in `package.json` but `start` is the most important.
